# NOTE : use nomodeset to boot into ubuntu without loading the nvidia drivers.

# NOTE : tried upgrading to nvidia driver 440, but this caused problems, and we could not boot,
#        so had to use nomodeset to boot without loading the nvidia drivers. Then we downgraded
#        back to 435. Somewhere along the way we also ran the following.
sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3
